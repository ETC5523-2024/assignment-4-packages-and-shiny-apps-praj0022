Description: The `copingmethods` package offers tools to explore mental health data, focusing on depression rates across age groups and coping mechanisms used by different countries. This package includes two datasets, `depression_age` (depression rates from 1990 to 2019 by age group) and `percent_copingmethods` (coping methods data for 2020). An interactive Shiny app allows users to analyze these trends interactively.
